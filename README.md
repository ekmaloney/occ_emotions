# Replication Materials

This repository contains all the data and code needed to replicate "The influence of occupational identity on emotional experience." For this analysis, I used the workflow package drake (https://github.com/ropensci/drake). Drake structures projects in pipelines -- the analysis plan is contained in the R file plan.R and the functions I constructed for the plan are in functions.R and packages necessary for the analysis are in packages.R. To run the plan, simply run the plan.R file. 

Please contact me at em.k.maloney@duke.edu if you have any difficulty with the replication or find an error.
